This is a website made on HTML about a startup business of abstract art.

I made this website to give me and my brother's businees/hustle a kickstart.
I used ([formspree.io]) to make the forms for my website.It is very easy to use and the responses actually get saved and can be viewed.
It is less complicated too.
I used this tutorial to make my forms in HTML and integrate it properly:([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVPlb5C3oQ8&t=231s])
Credits to:Jude Chucks for the forms in HTML thingy.

This website is built with a nice and proper ui,many pages and it is very informative.Check it out by clicking the demo.
